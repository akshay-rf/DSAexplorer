# DSA Explorer

DSA Explorer is a Java desktop application designed to explore and analyze fundamental data structures and algorithms. This interactive tool provides educational content, algorithm visualization, and performance analysis to enhance understanding and application of key concepts in computer science.


## Key Features

- **Algorithm Overview and Explanations:** Detailed explanations and demonstrations of essential data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., search, sort, graph traversal) implemented in Java.

- **Interactive Algorithm Visualization:** Visual representations of algorithm execution steps using Java Swing, allowing users to visualize how algorithms progress and manipulate data structures.

- **Performance Analysis Tools:** Built-in tools to measure and analyze algorithm performance on sample datasets, displaying metrics such as execution time, comparisons, and memory usage.

- **Sample Datasets and Custom Input:** Preloaded sample datasets representing arrays, graphs, and other structures to facilitate algorithm testing and analysis. Support for user-defined input to analyze algorithm performance on personalized data.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing for seamless navigation and interaction. User-friendly controls to select algorithms, adjust parameters (e.g., array size), and visualize algorithm behavior.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshay-rf/DSAexplorer.git
   ```
2. **Open in IDE:**
    - Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
